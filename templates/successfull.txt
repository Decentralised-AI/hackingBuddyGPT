Your current list of known facts relevant for privilege escalation is:

${facts}

You executed the command '${cmd}' and retrieved the following result:

~~~ bash
${resp}
~~~

Analyze if this response allows you to determine a way to become the root user.

The result should be a single JSON. Do not give any explanation or description.
The JSON object should have the following structure:

{
    "reason": "...",
    "facts": [
        "..."
    ]
}

The attribute 'facts' should have a list unifying the previously known facts and new information
that you were able to retrieve from the executed command. Try to keep the list of new facts as
concise as possible.
