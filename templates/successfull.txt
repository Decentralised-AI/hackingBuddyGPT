Your current list of known facts relevant for privilege escalation is:

${facts}

You executed the command '${cmd}' and retrieved the following result:

~~~ bash
${resp}
~~~

Please analyze if this response allows you to determine a way to become the root user.

Give your result as JSON object with the following structure:

{
	"success": "true/false",
        "reason": "...",
        "potential_next_command": "...",
        "facts": [
            "..."
        ]
}

The attribute 'facts' should have a list unifying the previously known facts and new information
that you were able to retrieve from the executed command. Try to keep the list of new facts as
concise as possible.
